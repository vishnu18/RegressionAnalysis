## General Information
- We have a dataset of the Bike Sharing sales based on date from 2018 and 2019.
- Find Predictor variables that influence the sales represented as cnt.  
- Influential Variables can be used to improve the overall sales
- Bike-Sharing can use this information to predict and then prepare the inventory based on the demand


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
The major variables which are the determining factors for Bike Sharing.
-  September Month
-  atemp
-  weather
-  WorkingDay
### If the month is September and weather is clear on workingDay then the Bike Sharing sales will increase.
